<h1>Reconciled BB84 Quantum Transmission</h1>
<b>(responder's side)</b>
</CENTER>
<BR>
<BR>
A reconciled BB84 key is obtained after applying a reconciliation
protocol to a plain BB84 key. Reconciliation is an interactive process
taking place over the classical channel and aiming at correcting the
errors between the sender and the receiver keys while disclosing
as less bits as possible. Reconciliation is performed by an interactive
protocol called <em>Cascade</em>. You can find more about 
reconciliation and the <em>Cascade</em>
protocol <a href="../../../doc/cascade.html">here</a>.
<BR>
<h2>Plain Key Generation</h2>
The first step in order to get a reconciled key is to first
generate a plain key which is subject to transmission errors
and only partially private:
<ul>
<li>
<a href="../PlainBB84/output2_1.html">PlainBB84</a>
</ul>
<BR>
The PlainBB84 subprotocol allowed
<b>Bob</b>
and
<b>Alice</b>
to define a plain key of <b>
185
</b> bits. The next step aims at 
correcting the errors between the sender's and receiver's
version of the plain key.
 
<BR>
<h2>Error-Correction Using Cascade</h2>
<BR>
<a href="../../../doc/cascade.html">Cascade</a> is an 
interactive and parity-based error-correction 
scheme. Before running <em>Cascade</em>, the inial blocksize
for parity testing must be chosen together with the number
of passes. 

<p>The initial blocksize <em>k<sub>0</sub></em> 
is chosen to be <em>k<sub>0</sub>=(1/e)+(1/4e)</em>
where <em>e</em> is the error estimate provided 
by the plain key generation. 
The blocksize <em>k<sub>i+1</sub></em>
for  pass <em>i+1</em> is defined as 
<em>k<sub>i+1</sub>=2k<sub>i</sub></em>. 
The last normal pass occurs when the blocksizes
exceeds <em>1/4</em>th of all bits.
Two extra passes
are used with blocksize about <em>n/4</em>. Note that
blocksize never exceeds  <em>1/4</em>th of all bits. 

<p>Given an an error-estimate 
of <b>
0.02
</b> and a BB84 plain key of size <b>
185
</b>, we get:
<ul>
<li>the initial blocksize <em>k<sub>0</sub></em>=<b>
35
</b>,
<li> the number of passes is <b>
4
</b>.
</ul>
<em>Cascade</em> fixed a total of <b>8</b> errors revealing <b>57</b> parity bits, where:
<ul>
<li><b>2</b> errors were corrected in pass <b>0</b> using block of size <b>35</b> revealing <b>16</b> parity bits.<li><b>0</b> errors were corrected in pass <b>1</b> using block of size <b>70</b> revealing <b>3</b> parity bits.<li><b>2</b> errors were corrected in pass <b>2</b> using block of size <b>70</b> revealing <b>14</b> parity bits.<li><b>4</b> errors were corrected in pass <b>3</b> using block of size <b>70</b> revealing <b>24</b> parity bits.</ul>

<br>
The reconciled bits are the following:
<FONT COLOR=darkgreen><BR><BR><B>01011&nbsp;00101&nbsp;00110&nbsp;00110&nbsp;01001&nbsp;&nbsp;00100&nbsp;10111&nbsp;00010&nbsp;10011&nbsp;1110<FONT COLOR=darkred>1</FONT>&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>

01011&nbsp;11<FONT COLOR=darkred>1</FONT>10&nbsp;10101&nbsp;10101&nbsp;11100&nbsp;&nbsp;00110&nbsp;1<FONT COLOR=darkred>0</FONT>011&nbsp;11010&nbsp;000<FONT COLOR=darkred>1</FONT>1&nbsp;01011&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
0<FONT COLOR=darkred>0</FONT>000&nbsp;00010&nbsp;00110&nbsp;01111&nbsp;100<FONT COLOR=darkred>1</FONT>0&nbsp;&nbsp;00011&nbsp;11101&nbsp;</FONT></B><BR>
<br>
<ul>
<li> <FONT COLOR="darkred"><b>Those</b></FONT> positions have been corrected,
<li> <FONT COLOR="darkgreen"><b>Those</b></FONT> positions are the bits 
     for which no error was detected.
</ul>
The next phase is the confirmation of the equality
of the initiator's and responder's reconciled keys.
If <em>Cascade</em> has succeeded then the next step should 
confirm it.

<h2>Confirmation</h2>

In order to make sure that no error remains, the parity
of random subsets of positions are exchanged and compared. In general, 
if <em>w</em> parity bits are compared and found identical
then the initiator's and the responder's 
keys are identical except with probability
2<SUP>-<em>w</em></SUP>. In this experiment, 
<br>
<UL><LI>Confirmation by publicly comparing <b>10</b> parity bits was performed.
<LI>Confirmation is <b><u>successfull</u></b>.
<LI>Bob's and Alice's keys are identical except with probability <b>2<SUP>-10</SUP></b>,which is about <b>9.765625E-4</b>.
</UL>
<br>
<h2>Statistics & Overview</h2>
Here are some statistics about this execution.
<ul>
<li>The observed error-rate is <b>
0.043243244
</b> compared to the expected value <b>
0.02
</b> produced by error-sampling.
<li>The total number of parity bits disclosed during both reconciliation
and confirmation is <b>
67
</b>.
<li>The reconciliation rate is  
<em>R=(n-c)/n</em> where <em>c</em> is the total 
number of parity bits revealed and <em>n</em> is the size of the plain
BB84 key. For this execution we have <em>R=</em><b>
0.6378378
</b> compared to the optimal Shannon bound <em>R<sub>min</sub>=</em><b>
0.7430303
</b>.
<li> Reconciliation has produced identical keys with probability <b>
0.99902344
</b>.
</ul>
