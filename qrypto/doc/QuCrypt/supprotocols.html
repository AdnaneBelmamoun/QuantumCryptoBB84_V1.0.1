<font size=+4>QuCrypt's Support for Quantum Protocols</font></h1></center>
<font size=+1>Protocols in <b>QuCrypt</b> can be easily added by specializing
the existing ones.&nbsp; For the time being, only quantum key distribution
protocols are provided. Two kinds of quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols
are implemented in <b>QuCrypt</b>.&nbsp; They are:</font>
<ul>
<li>
<font size=+1><a href="bb84prot.html">BB84 Quantum key distribution</a>
protocol, and</font></li>

<li>
<font size=+1><a href="b92prot.html">B92 Quantum key distribution</a> protocol.</font></li>
</ul>
<font size=+1>In addition, some itermediary versions of both QKD protocols
are provided for future extension of the protocol library. Each protocol
being built by specializing subprotocols, we get the following specialization
chain:</font>
<ul>
<li>
<font size=+1>Raw BB84 -> Reconciled BB84 -> Full BB84</font></li>

<li>
<font size=+1>Raw B92&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -> Reconciled B92&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
-> Full B92.</font></li>
</ul>
<font size=+1>Each of these intermediary versions are reusable inside different
protocols or different implementations of the currently supported schemes.&nbsp;
To see how to build your own quantum protocol, look at how the implementation
of the <a href="http://www.brics.dk/home/louis/anyj/projects/qrypto/protocols/BB84.java">full
BB84</a> QKD protocol uses the implementation of <a href="http://www.brics.dk/home/louis/anyj/projects/qrypto/protocols/RecBB84.java">reconciled
BB84</a> in the <a href="http://www.brics.dk/home/louis/anyj/projects/qrypto/protocols/">protocols
package</a>.</font>
<p><font size=+1>The goal would be to develop a large library of subprotocols
in order to make quantum protocols easy to implement by putting together
the reusable components that are the most adapted to a specific task. JAVA
being an object oriented programming language makes it a good choice for
achieving this goal.</font>
<h3>
<font size=+1>Raw Quantum Transmission</font></h3>
<font size=+1>The <i>Raw BB84</i> and <i>Raw B92</i> are subprotocols allowing
to generate the raw key from which public discussion between Alice and
Bob should produce the final secret key.&nbsp; The raw key is simply the
raw material produced by the quantum transmission using the <a href="bb84coding.html">BB84
coding</a> scheme and the <a href="b92coding.html">B92 coding</a> scheme
respectively.&nbsp; The raw part of QKD protocols is a kind of general
primitives that can be used as the quantum part for more general quantum
protocols.&nbsp; If one wants to provide a different quantum protocol using
either <i>Raw BB84</i> or <i>Raw B92</i> for the quantum transmission part
then one just writes the specification of the classical part of the protocol
taking place after the&nbsp; raw key generation.&nbsp; The raw key can
also be stored (only in the next
<b>QuCrypt</b>'s release though) for future
processing involving maybe only classical channels.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
<font size=+1>Reconciled Quantum Transmission</font></h3>
<font size=+1>The reconciled quantum transmission is the string Alice and
Bob get after having corrected the transmission errors in the <i>Raw key</i>.&nbsp;
For the time being only one reconciliation scheme is included in <b>QuCrypt</b>.&nbsp;
After Alice and Bob have applied reconciliation, they make sure that no
error is left by executing another classical subprotocol called <i>confirmation</i>.&nbsp;
Both <i>reconciliation</i> and <i>confirmation</i> can be redefined by
providing new protocol specifications.&nbsp; For an example of how to provide
your own reconciliation or confirmation protocol, look at how <a href="http://www.brics.dk/home/louis/anyj/projects/qrypto/protocols/Cascade.java">Cascade</a>
has been included in <a href="http://www.brics.dk/home/louis/anyj/projects/qrypto/protocols/RecBB84.java">RecBB84</a>
and <a href="http://www.brics.dk/home/louis/anyj/projects/qrypto/protocols/RecB92.java">RecB92</a>.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
<font size=+1>Full QKD</font></h2>
<font size=+1>The final secret key is obtained by applying <i>privacy amplification</i>
to the <i>reconciled key</i>. Different methods can be added to the one
available in <b>QuCrypt</b>.&nbsp; The current privacy amplification protocol
is implemented in the <a href="http://www.brics.dk/home/louis/anyj/projects/qrypto/protocols/PrivacyAmplification.java">PA
class</a> and are used in <a href="http://www.brics.dk/home/louis/anyj/projects/qrypto/protocols/BB84.java">BB84</a>
and <a href="http://www.brics.dk/home/louis/anyj/projects/qrypto/protocols/B92.java">B92</a>
the obvious way.</font>
